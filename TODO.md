# TODO List - Roo's Tasks

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

### MedTech Intelligence - Vueroo API Setup
**Status:** Data cleaned, awaiting GitHub setup
**Created:** 2026-03-20 10:31

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Create GitHub private repository: `medtech-intelligence-data`
- [ ] Upload cleaned JSON files:
  - `epidemiological-data.json`
  - `competition-data.json`
- [ ] Generate GitHub Personal Access Token (scopes: `repo`)
- [ ] Share token securely with Lumina

**Then Lumina will:**
- [ ] Build Vueroo API endpoint: `https://vueroo.com/api/medtech/data`
- [ ] Configure environment variable for GitHub token
- [ ] Update local HTML files to use API instead of local JSON
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow

**Files ready at:**
`C:\Users\impro\.openclaw\workspace\medtech-intelligence\dashboard\data\clean\`

**Architecture:**
```
Local HTML → Vueroo API → GitHub Private Repo (token hidden)
```

**Benefits:**
- Token never exposed to client
- Data protected behind authentication
- HTML shell contains no proprietary data
- Scrapers see nothing without login
